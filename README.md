# Recipe-app
This repo holds the source code of a Recipe app built with ROR that keeps track of recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It allows users to save ingredients, keep track of their saved information, create recipes, and generate shopping lists based on what they have and what they are missing from a recipe.
